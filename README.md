# Gujarati-Emotion-Recognition-Using-CNN-LSTM
😂🥰😎😥😡😖😪 
## Detecting Seven Emotions in Gujarat with the accuracy of 87%
The project i worked on have a Tri model concept-  Basically to achieve the accuracy, I have divided emotions into three different Models
1 - [Positive,  Negative, Neutral]
2 - [Happy, Joy, Surprise]
3 - [Anger, Sad, Fear]

# DataSet:
🧐 It's was an English Dataset have 20k lines with 6 emotions, into that have added more 10k lines with only neutral sentiment make it total 6 sentiments

🔁 With the use of AWS Translate, 30k English sentences where translated into Gujarati. Now most important part of any Data Science project come to role

# Data Cleaning:
🛀 Data was cleaned, which consist of awful language, untranslated word, numbers and sentences making no sense.
Intially some translated data was gibris which was remove and some was cleaned. Reducing the data by 2%.

# Model Selection:

🔎 For the purpose i was confused between ML algorithms and DL algorithms, Obviously DL algorithm made much more sense in the preformance and accuracy
